# Minesweeper

## Summary

This repository contains a java implementation of minesweeper, with a GUI made with the swing library and designed to look like the classic minesweeper game. 

## How to run

Clone the repository

Open a terminal in the project directory

run 'javac *.java' in the terminal

```
$ javac *.java
```

run 'java Display' in the terminal

```
$ java Display
```

This will open a window in which the game can be played. Once the window is closed, the terminal program will exit with it. Do not close the terminal while playing, as this will close the game as well.
